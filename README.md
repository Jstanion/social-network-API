# Week 18: Social Network API

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

## Description

This project allowed me to focus on backend database building using a No SQL programming language like MongoDB/Mongoose. As a full-stack developer I want to strengthen skills in both back and front-end design and structure. Having experience in building a cocial network database is crucial in todays world. There are so many applications and companies that rely on databases in the social network market. I wanted to show that I have the experience and ability to do so as well. This application is a basic example of social networking functionality and what data is passed from the back-end to the front, when considering web development. My goal is to give the user a better understanding of the typical data necessary in creating a database API for social networking applications. Understanding the relationship between varying sets of data in a language that does not use SQL was challenging at first. Once the connections were made, I was quickly able to see how information can be stored inside larger sets of related data. Similarly, I was able to see how targeting certain data within a full dataset would be affected without the use of MySQL.
